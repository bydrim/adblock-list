## Block ads and stuff

This is my custom adblocker rules. I use this with uBlock Origin but the rules probably work with most popular adblockers.  

## How To Use
Copy the links below and use your adblocker's 'add a list' functionality. 

- [LinkedIn](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bydrim/adblock-list/refs/heads/main/linkedin.txt)
- [Youtube Shorts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bydrim/adblock-list/refs/heads/main/youtube-shorts.txt)

#### uBlock
Open Dashboard > Filter Lists > Import . Paste the urls and then click 'Apply Changes' on top.

#### Brave Browser (also works on mobile)
Open Settings > Shields > Shields > Content Filtering > Add custom filter lists. Paste the links you desire and click add.
